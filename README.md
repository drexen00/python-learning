# python-learning
My Python learning journey — from basics to projects.  Includes notes, practice scripts, and mini-projects.


##  Structure
- **01_basics/** → variables, conditions, loops, functions  
- **02_collections/** → lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  
- **03_oop/** → classes, inheritance, magic methods  
- **04_modules_packages/** → imports, working with modules  
- **05_files_exceptions/** → files, JSON, exceptions  
- **06_projects_mini/** → small projects (calculator, ToDo, etc.)  
- **07_algorithms/** → recursion, sorting, searching  

##  Goals
- Learn Python step by step and build real projects  
- Reinforce knowledge through practice tasks and mini-apps  
- Prepare for algorithmic challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank)  

##  Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Git / GitHub for version control  
- VSCode as IDE
